# S3 React Typescript CDK Application

This is a project for TypeScript development with CDK.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Manual deployment guide

### Pre-reqs

1. Deploy Toolkit Stack for AWS account

Example error:
```
 ‚ùå  S3ReactPersonalWebsite failed: Error: This stack uses assets, so the toolkit stack must be deployed to the environment (Run "cdk bootstrap aws://459641237997/us-east-1")
```
2. Deploy `ScaffoldStack` to init required AWS resources with the following command:
```
npm run cdk deploy ScaffoldStack
```

### Modifying website

1. Modify React code
2. Run build from root directory for `cdk` and `website`
3. Run:
```
npm run cdk deploy S3ReactPersonalWebsite
```

## GitHub Actions Deployment

Automatic deployments to S3 bucket when a push is made to `main`.

### Pre-reqs
The CDK application will generate an IAM User with least-privileged access to the necessary AWS deployment resources.

1. You can generate access/private key pair for that user on AWS console
2. Add these as `secrets` in the GitHub repo settings under

        `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
        `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

### Change CDK constants

Change constants used by the CDK app (AWS account ID, domain name) in `cdk/constants.ts`.

## Useful commands

 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
